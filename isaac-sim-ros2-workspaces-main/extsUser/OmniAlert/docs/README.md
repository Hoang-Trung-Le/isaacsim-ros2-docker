   - Configure API connection in the API tab
   - Click "Connect" to start receiving alerts

2. **Managing Alerts**:
   - View active alerts in the Dashboard tab
   - Click alert items to navigate to affected locations
   - Use acknowledge/resolve buttons for alert lifecycle management
   - Apply filters to focus on specific alert types

3. **Emergency Procedures**:
   - Use the Emergency Stop button to dismiss all notifications
   - Critical alerts will automatically trigger visual and audio notifications

### Advanced Features

#### Custom Alert Templates
Create custom alert templates using the provided JSON structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Custom Alert",
  "severity": "high",
  "category": "equipment",
  "message_template": "Alert for {device_id} in {location}",
  "actions": [
    {
      "id": "inspect",
      "label": "Inspect Device",
      "icon": "üîç",
      "callback": "navigate_to_location"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Camera Navigation
Alerts with location data enable automatic camera navigation:
- Click the "üîç View" button on any alert
- Camera smoothly animates to the alert location
- Configurable animation duration and camera distance

#### Bulk Operations
Manage multiple alerts efficiently:
- **Acknowledge All New**: Mark all new alerts as acknowledged
- **Resolve All Acknowledged**: Resolve all acknowledged alerts
- **Clear Resolved**: Remove resolved alerts from the dashboard
- **Export**: Save alert data for analysis

## API Integration

### Alert Data Format
Alerts must follow the standard format:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-alert-id",
  "title": "Alert Title",
  "message": "Detailed alert message",
  "severity": "critical",
  "category": "safety",
  "status": "new",
  "timestamp": 1703123456.789,
  "location": {
    "x": 10.5,
    "y": 5.2,
    "z": 1.8,
    "prim_path": "/World/Equipment/Device_01"
  },
  "source": "safety_monitor",
  "tags": ["urgent", "equipment"],
  "affected_objects": ["/World/Equipment/Device_01"]
}
```

### Supported Endpoints
- `GET /api/alerts` - Fetch alerts
- `POST /alerts/{id}/actions` - Send alert actions
- `WebSocket /ws` - Real-time alert streaming

## Architecture

### Components
- **AlertManager**: Core alert state management
- **NotificationSystem**: Popup and sound notifications
- **CameraController**: 3D scene navigation
- **APIClient**: External system integration
- **AlertDashboard**: Main UI dashboard

### Data Flow
1. **Alert Ingestion**: API client fetches alerts from external sources
2. **Processing**: Alert manager processes and stores alerts
3. **Notification**: Notification system displays popups for new alerts
